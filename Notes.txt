useEffect(()=>{},[arg1]);

Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components:
 NOTE:- The meaning of passing arg1 is, that useEffect will only run if the value of arg1 changes otherwise it will skip and improve the performance
 it is similiar like we use to do in componentDidUpdate(), by checking prevstate/prevProps with currentstate/currentProps
